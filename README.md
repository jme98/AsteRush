# AsteRush!

### Created by Logan Giese and Jennifer Easter

Made as a project for an Unreal Game Programming class.

Compete head-to-head with another player in a revamped version of Asteroids where you collect resources from broken asteroids to buy upgrades and attempt to finish the game with more resources than your opponent!  Designed for both keyboard and controller gameplay, and now with improved graphics!

Get out there and shoot some space rocks, cadet!


(Developed with Unreal Engine 4)
